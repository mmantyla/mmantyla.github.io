<hr />
<p>This document outlines the steps to conduct a (mini) systematic
literature review (SLR) as part of a master’s thesis. A full systematic
literature review is known for its notorious laboriousness. As a result,
several steps have been adapted to make the process more manageable.</p>
<p>In addition to the mini SLR, you will explore current trends related
to your topic, formulate your research questions and method, and assess
whether the existing literature provides any datasets or instruments
that you could utilize in your master’s thesis. A successful master’s
thesis should also encompass an empirical and/or constructive
component.</p>
<h2 id="task-1---topic-selection">Task 1 - Topic Selection</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-select-a-software-engineering-topic">Step 1: Select a
Software Engineering Topic</h3>
<p>Choose a software engineering topic to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-research">Step 2: Research</h3>
<p>Study some current topics in software engineering and determine how
your chosen topic compares among them. It’s good to understand your
topic’s history and its popularity. It is acceptable to iterate between
Steps 2 and 3 until a topic is chosen. You can also investigate and
present multiple topics. To research your topic, it is suggested to use
multiple tools as listed below:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p><a
href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=java,python">Google
Trends</a> - In Google Trends, it’s best to view topics over years
rather than days or hours.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=java%2Cpython">Stackoverflow
trends</a> allow comparisons similar to Google Trends but focus on
software-specific topics.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic">Scopus</a>
is an academic database. Access to Scopus may require a VPN or may only
be available from the university network. Compare the paper counts per
year for your topic against some other topics. <a
href="Scopus_paper_counts.png">See the example of how to find paper
counts</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask a large language model like <a
href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> to compare your topic to
alternative topics. Try to get it to make a judgment call and present
similarities and differences between topics.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="step-3-keywords">Step 3: Keywords</h3>
<p>Think about initial keywords that would be beneficial for researching
your topic further.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-research-questions">Step 4: Research Questions</h3>
<p>Consider what your research questions are that you intend to
investigate.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-write-a-report">Step 5: Write a Report</h3>
<p>Compose a report about the chosen topic, which should encompass the
following sections:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Topic Description</strong> - Define the topic you aim to
investigate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Motivation</strong> - Elaborate on why you or your
employer find this topic significant. Why is the topic important in a
broader context?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research</strong> - Collect data and screenshots from the
mentioned sources and tools: Google Trends, Stackoverflow trends,
Scopus, and ChatGPT.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Search Terms</strong> - Introduce an initial list of
Search terms for literature searches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Questions</strong> - Propose an initial research
question. (This can also be framed as a research goal or research
problem.)</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="task-2-define-key-words-and-initial-search-results">Task 2
Define key words and initial search results</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-learn-about-different-literature-review-methods">Step 1:
Learn About Different Literature Review Methods</h3>
<p>Familiarize yourself with various methods for analyzing academic
literature by watching these videos. The combined runtime is 35 minutes:
<a
href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTUjKYPvVhe6t9pRm0PQDD6xMxUXjX9vP">Video
Playlist</a>.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-define-search-terms">Step 2: Define Search Terms</h3>
<p>What are your search terms? Think of all the synonyms you can
imagine. Utilize a synonym engine, such as <a
href="https://www.thesaurus.com/">Thesaurus.com</a>. Examine the related
search suggestions on Google and Google Scholar. Consult ChatGPT.
Identifying all possible synonyms can be challenging. Despite the
availability of these tools, seeking advice from an expert is
beneficial. For instance, while “testing” might synonymize with
“sampling,” “software sampling” does not synonymize with “software
testing.”</p>
<h3 id="step-3-refine-search-terms-based-on-search-results">Step 3:
Refine Search Terms Based on Search Results</h3>
<p>Do test searches and ensure your synonyms make sense. <a
href="Scopus_Irrelevant_paper.png">This search finds papers with the
search term “continuous integration”</a>. However, we can see it
includes papers we should exclude as they are not about continuous
integration related to software development. Exclusion can be done by
adding more inclusion search terms, adding exclusion search terms, and
including or excluding subject areas. <a
href="Scopus_Irrelevant_paper.png">See the figure for more
details</a>.</p>
<p>A search string consists of search terms, the fields where these
terms are applied, and the Boolean operators connecting these terms. For
example, the search string</p>
<p><code>TITLE-ABS-KEY ("continuous integration") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY ("software testing")</code></p>
<p>has:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>two search terms: “continuous integration” and “software
testing”,</p></li>
<li><p>the terms are applied to the fields of title, abstract, and
keywords (represented by TITLE-ABS-KEY), and</p></li>
<li><p>the terms are connected with the Boolean operator AND.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3
id="step-4-conduct-initial-searches-and-analyze-selected-papers">Step 4:
Conduct Initial Searches and Analyze Selected Papers</h3>
<p>Study the top 5 papers as ranked by Google Scholar. Google Scholar
ranks papers based on relevance, usually yielding accurate results.
While Scopus offers more accurate search string speficition, its
relevance-based rankings might not be as effective as those from Google
Scholar.</p>
<p>Do the paper help you identify new search terms?</p>
<p>Do the papers help you to improve your research questions?</p>
<p>Do the papers have similar methodology that you plan to use?</p>
<p>Do the papers have any data collection, processing or analysing
instruments you could use, e.g. survey forms, interview questions,
source code for data processing, algorithms.</p>
<p>Do the papers utilize any open data sets you could also analyze?</p>
<h3 id="step-5-write-a-report-1">Step 5: Write a Report</h3>
<p>Compose a report with the following sections:</p>
<p>i.) <strong>Benefits of SLR</strong> - Discuss the advantages of a
systematic literature review and explain why it’s crucial to clearly
define your search terms.</p>
<p>ii.) <strong>Final Search String</strong> - Report the final search
string.</p>
<p>iii.) <strong>Evolution of the Search String</strong> - Detail the
actions taken to derive the final search string. Describe the initial
search string and specify which terms were added or removed during its
refinement.</p>
<p>iv.) <strong>Number of Papers Found</strong> - Indicate the number of
papers found in Scopus.</p>
<p>v.) <strong>Five Relevant Papers</strong> - Share insights gained
from the five most pertinent papers.</p>
<p>vi.) <strong>Initial Research Framework</strong> - State your
research questions, outline the research method you intend to adopt, and
describe the data or data collection instruments you plan to use or
collect.</p>
<h2 id="task-3-search-results-initial-include-and-exclude-criteria">Task
3 Search results &amp; Initial Include and Exclude criteria</h2>
<h3
id="step-1---finalize-search-strings-and-assess-number-of-papers-found">Step
1 - Finalize Search Strings and Assess Number of Papers Found</h3>
<p>How many papers does your search string yield in Scopus? If the
number of papers exceeds 400 or is fewer than 20, revert to steps 3 and
4 to refine your search strings.</p>
<p>The upper boundary (≤400) is established to manage the effort
required in the subsequent step, wherein each paper will be evaluated
with respect to include/exclude criteria. This involves reading the
paper title, abstract, and essential sections to make
inclusion/exclusion decisions. Assuming it takes approximately 5 minutes
to evaluate a single paper, it will require 33 hours merely to evaluate
the papers.</p>
<p>The lower boundary (≥20) ensures the presence of ample evidence. If,
after reassessing the search strings, fewer than 20 papers are
identified, you should broaden your search to encompass grey literature.
In such a case, consider undertaking a (mini) <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584918301939">Multivocal
Literature Review</a> (<a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02553">non-paywalled version</a>).</p>
<h3 id="step-2-search-statistics">Step 2: Search Statistics</h3>
<p>Within Scopus, click <a href="Scopus_analyze_papers.png">analyze
results</a>. Report on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documents per year</li>
<li>Author</li>
<li>Affiliation</li>
<li>Country</li>
<li>Document type</li>
<li>Subject area</li>
</ul>
<p>Include screenshots to support your findings and provide a brief
description or commentary for each item.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-applying-inclusion-and-exclusion-criteria">Step 3:
Applying Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<p>Develop your preliminary criteria for inclusion and exclusion. For
guidance, refer to <a href="https://youtu.be/kXsWuYXd_j8?t=536">this
timestamped link for a refresher video about inclusion and exclusion
criteria</a>.</p>
<p>Apply these criteria to 10 selected papers by reading the paper
titles, abstracts, keywords, and by performing full-text skimming. Based
on the results, consider if there’s a need to modify your criteria.</p>
<p>Once you’ve established the initial criteria, reflect on whether
there’s an opportunity to refine your search string. If any paper
attribute can be automatically filtered, it’s best to do so in the
search string rather than during the manual inclusion/exclusion process.
This can reduce manual labor. For instance, Criteria 1: “The paper must
contain empirical evidence” is ambiguous and challenging to translate
into a precise search string. However, Criteria 2: “The paper must
provide evidence from a controlled experiment” can be specified as a
search criterion by appending “… AND TITLE-ABS-KEY(Experiment)” to the
search string.</p>
<p>Also consider: Do the papers help you to improve your research
questions?</p>
<p>Do the papers have similar methodology that you plan to use?</p>
<p>Do the papers have any data collection, processing or analysing
instruments you could use, e.g. survey forms, interview questions,
source code for data processing, algorithms.</p>
<p>Do the papers utilize any open data sets you could also analyze?</p>
<h3 id="step-4-write-a-report">Step 4: Write a Report</h3>
<p>Compose a report with the following sections:</p>
<p>i.) <strong>Final Search String and Number of Papers
Found</strong><br />
Explain the modifications you made to the search strings and how many
papers they produced. Include a screenshot from Scopus with accompanying
text.</p>
<p>ii.) <strong>Initial Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong><br />
Explain your inclusion and exclusion criteria. Did you find any
opportunities to refine the search string? What were your experiences in
applying the criteria. Report the assessment outcomes for all 10 papers
in a table format, as illustrated below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="include_exclude_table.png"
alt="Include / Exclude outcomes illustration" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Include / Exclude outcomes
illustration</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>iii.) <strong>Research Framework</strong><br />
Report any changes made to the research framework: research questions,
research methods, and the data or data collection instruments you plan
to use or collect.</p>
<h2

4 - Results of Include/Exclude Criteria and Initial Findings</h2>
<p>In this task, you will report your final inclusion and exclusion
criteria and the results of applying them. You will also report the
initial findings from the papers.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-export-papers-and-apply-inclusionexclusion-criteria">Step
1: Export Papers and Apply Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Using Scopus, export all papers (before exporting, select all
papers, then click “export”). Please see the suggested fields to export
<a href="What_fields_to_export.png">to a CSV file</a>. Add your
inclusion/exclusion criteria to this CSV file. Read through all titles
and abstracts, and do full-text skimming if needed. Provide a report
