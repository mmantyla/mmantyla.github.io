<title>Bad code smells - A Taxonomy</title>

<h1>A Taxonomy for &quot;Bad Code Smells&quot; </h1>
<h3>Citation</h3>
<p>If you wish to cite this taxonomy please use the following article</p>
<p>M채ntyl채, M. V. and Lassenius, C. <b>&quot;Subjective Evaluation of Software 
Evolvability Using Code Smells: An Empirical Study&quot;</b>. Journal of Empirical 
Software Engineering, vol. 11, no. 3, 2006, pp. 395-431. (<a target="_top" href="http://www.soberit.hut.fi/~mmantyla/ESE_2006.pdf">pdf</a>)</p>
<h3>Taxonomy</h3>
<p>The reason for creating the taxonomy is to provide better understanding of 
the smells and to recognize the relationships between smells. I feel that with a 
long flat list of the code smells it is easy to lose the overall picture (at least that 
happened to me when I first studied the list of code smells in (Fowler&amp;Beck 
2000)). Thus, here is a taxonomy of five groups.</p>
<table border="1" width="100%" id="table1">
	<tr>
		<td>
		<h3>Group name</h3>
		</td>
		<td>
		<h3>Smells in group</h3>
		</td>
		<td width="898">
		<h3>Discussion</h3>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>The Bloaters</b></td>
		<td>-Long Method<br>
        -Large Class<br>
        -Primitive Obsession<br>
        -Long Parameter List<br>
        -DataClumps</td>
		<td width="898">
		Bloater smells represents something that has grown so large that it 
		cannot be effectively handled.<p>It seems likely that these smells&nbsp;grow 
		a little bit at a time. Hopefully nobody designs, e.g., 
		Long Methods.</p>
		<p>
		Primitive Obsession is actually more of a symptom that causes bloats 
		than a bloat itself. The same holds for Data Clumps<i>. </i>When a 
		Primitive Obsession exists, there are no small classes for small entities 
		(e.g. phone numbers). Thus, the functionality is added to some 
		other class, which increases the class and method size in the 
		software. With Data Clumps there exists a set of primitives that always 
		appear together (e.g. 3 integers for RGB colors). Since these data items 
		are not encapsulated in a class this increases the sizes of methods and 
		classes.&nbsp; </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>The Object-Orientation Abusers </b></td>
		<td>-Switch Statements<br>
		-Temporary Field<br>
		-Refused Bequest<br>
		-Alternative 
		Classes with Different Interfaces</td>
		<td width="898">
		The common denominator for the smells in the Object-Orientation Abuser 
		category is that they represent cases where the solution does not fully 
		exploit the possibilities of object-oriented design.<p>For example, a Switch Statement might be considered acceptable or even good 
design in procedural programming, but is something that should be avoided in 
object-oriented programming. The situation where switch statements or type codes 
are needed should be handled by creating subclasses. Parallel Inheritance 
Hierarchies and Refused Bequest smells lack proper inheritance design, which is 
one of the key elements in object-oriented programming. The Alternative Classes 
with Different Interfaces smell lacks a common interface for closely related 
classes, so it can also be considered a certain type of inheritance misuse. The 
Temporary Field smell means a case in which a variable is in the class scope, when it 
should be in method scope. This violates the information hiding principle. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>The Change Preventers </b></td>
		<td>-Divergent Change<br>
		-Shotgun Surgery <br>
		-Parallel Inheritance 
		Hierarchies </td>
		<td width="898">
		Change Preventers are smells is that hinder changing or further 
		developing the software<p>These smells violate the rule 
		suggested by Fowler and Beck which says that classes and possible 
		changes should have a one-to-one relationship. For example, changes to 
		the database only affect one class, while changes to calculation 
		formulas only affect the other class.</p>
		<p>The Divergent Change smell means that we have a single class that 
		needs to be modified by many different types of changes. With the Shotgun Surgery 
		smell the situation is the opposite, we need to modify many classes when 
		making a single change to a system (change several classes when changing 
		database from one vendor to another)</p>
		<p>Parallel 
		Inheritance Hierarchies, which means a duplicated class hierarchy,
		was originally placed in OO-abusers. One could also place it 
		inside of The Dispensables since there is redundant logic that should be 
		replaced. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>The Dispensables</b></td>
		<td>-Lazy class<br>
		-Data class <br>
		-Duplicate Code<br>
		-Dead Code, <br>
		-Speculative Generality</td>
		<td width="898">
		The common thing for the 
Dispensable smells is that they all represent something unnecessary that should 
be removed from the source code.<p>This group contains two types of smells 
		(dispensable classes and 
dispensable code), but since they violate the same principle, we will look at 
them together.&nbsp;If a class is not doing enough it needs to be removed or 
its responsibility needs to be increased. This is the case with the Lazy class and 
		the Data class smells. Code that is not used or is redundant needs to be 
removed. This is the case with Duplicate Code, Speculative Generality and Dead 
Code smells.&nbsp; </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>The Couplers</b></td>
		<td>-Feature Envy<br>
		-Inappropriate Intimacy<br>
		-Message Chains <br>
		-Middle 
		Man</td>
		<td width="898">
		This group has four coupling-related smells. 
		<p>One design principle that has been around for decades is low coupling 
		(Stevens et al. 1974) . This group has 3 
		smells that represent high coupling. Middle Man smell on the other hand 
		represent a problem that might be created when trying to avoid high 
		coupling with constant delegation. Middle Man is a class that is doing 
		too much simple delegation instead of really contributing to the 
		application. </p>
		<p>The Feature Envy smell means a case where one method is too 
		interested in other classes, and the Inappropriate Intimacy smell means 
		that two classes are coupled tightly to each other. Message Chains is a 
		smell where class A needs data from class D. To access this data, class 
		A needs to retrieve object C from object B (A and B have a direct reference). 
		When class A gets object C it then asks C to get object D. When class A 
		finally has a reference to class D, A asks D for the data it needs. The 
		problem here is that A becomes unnecessarily coupled to classes B, C, and D, when it only needs some piece of data from class D. 
		The following example illustrates the message chain smell: <font face="Courier New" size="2">
		A.getB().getC().getD().getTheNeededData()</font></p>
		<p>Of course, I could make an argument that these smells should belong to the 
Object-Orientation abusers group, but since they all focus strictly on 
coupling, I think it makes the taxonomy more understandable if they are 
introduced in a group of their own.</td>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><b>In what way is this taxonomy better than the one provided in the 
Refactoring Workbook (Wake 2003)? </b> <br>
It is shorter ;-). Seriously, this is left as an exercise for the reader. If you 
like mine better - great. If you like their better - fine. </p>
<p><b>Hey, I could argue that all smells should be placed inside a certain group 
(Change Preventers or OO abusers) since they all prevent change / abuse OO 
principles. </b><br>
This is true. However, then we would not receive any increased understanding from the 
classification. </p>
